# Patterns and Event Optimization Tasks

## Description

This repository contains JavaScript tasks focused on DOM manipulation, event handling, and optimization techniques. It includes implementations of interactive UI components, event delegation, and best practices for handling user interactions efficiently.

## Installation

 Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

## Usage

Each task is structured in separate files for clarity. The tasks include:

### Task 1: Image Gallery

- Creates an interactive image gallery using `basicLightbox`.
- Clicking on an image opens a modal with a larger version.
- The modal can be closed by clicking outside the image or pressing the `Escape` key.
- Prevents page reload and processes user input dynamically.
- Implements form validation and submission using event listeners.
- Demonstrates efficient event handling using event delegation.
- Optimized for dynamically added elements.
### Task 2: SimpleLightbox Integration

- Similar to Task 1 but uses the `SimpleLightbox` library.
- Enables caption display with a delay of 250ms.
- Allows image scrolling with arrow keys.
  
## Dependencies

- `basicLightbox`
- `SimpleLightbox`
